Enabling automatic updates for RHEL/CentOS 8

The procedure is as follows:

    Open the terminal application.
    Search and find CentOS/RHEL 8 package named dnf-automatic:
    sudo dnf search dnf-automatic
    sudo dnf info dnf-automatic
    Search and Enable Automatic updates on RHEL 8, CentOS 8 and Fedora Linux

    Searching for packages
    Install the package using the dnf command/yum command:
    sudo yum install dnf-automatic
    How to install and enable automatic updates for RHEL CentOS 8 server

    Installing systemd timer to perform automatic updates
    Edit the /etc/dnf/automatic.conf file as per your requirements:
    sudo vim /etc/dnf/automatic.conf
    Make sure apply_updates set to yes. Otherwise, dnf-automatic will only download updates.
    Finally turn on the service using the systemctl command:
    sudo systemctl enable --now dnf-automatic.timer
    Sample outputs:

    Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/timers.target.wants/dnf-automatic.timer â†’ /usr/lib/systemd/system/dnf-automatic.timer.

Instead of installing updates we can get notification as follows (make sure you disable dnf-automatic.timer):
sudo systemctl enable --now dnf-automatic-notifyonly.timer

Just wanted to download updates? Try
sudo systemctl enable --now dnf-automatic-download

The systemd timer unit dnf-automatic.timer will behave as the configuration file specifies (see below) concerning whether to download and apply updates. Therefore we will look into config options too.
Understnading config options

So far, so good. We have installed and enabled automatic updates for RHEL/CentOS 8 server. Next, Edit the /etc/dnf/automatic.conf to tweak settings as per your liking:
sudo vim /etc/dnf/automatic.conf

Should updates be downloaded when they are available?
download_updates = yes

What to do with downloaded updates on your CentOS/RHEL 8 box? Apply them ASAP:
# Only download
apply_updates = no
# If you want to apply them, then set to 'yes'
#apply_updates = yes

How to notify Linux sysadmin or developer when updates applied to the system? Valid options are stdio, email, motd, and None/Empty value. I wanted updates via email. Hence, I set up
emit_via = email

Set the address to send email messages from:
email_from = webmater@your-domain

We need set up email addresses to send messages to:
email_to = vivek@your-domain

Name of the host/ip (smtp) server to connect to to send email messages.
email_host = lan-smpt-your-doamin
