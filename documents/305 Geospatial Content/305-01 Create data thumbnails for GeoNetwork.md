**Purpose:**

This document describes how to create a large and small thumbnail for a metadata record from an existing image, subsequently used by GeoNetwork to create somewhat like a Google search result. This description uses ImageMagick, but many other applications could be used.

ImageMagick has huge image manipulation capability; this process just describes a basic resizing operation to generate thumbnails. ImageMagick can also improve a wide variety of source image deficiencies.
