**Purpose:**

This document describes one way to create a metadata record to be later stored on the GeoNetwork server, using the java application jNAP. Other possible editing tools are listed in the document “Common Metadata Editing Tools” (305-F01 ).

Creating metadata outside GeoNetwork is useful if many metadata records of a somewhat similar type or series are to be created, because all such records with their associated data files, links and thumbnails can be loaded in one later step.

Some of the jNAP features are:

-   Machine independent (java application)

-   Graphical interface

-   Bilingual – English, French

-   creates metadata compliant with the North American profile (but using gml, not gml/3.2)

-   extensive help appears during hover over field label

-   built-in thesauri for theme (GCMD v6 and Gov of Canada keywords) and place (Canada locations)

-   automatically builds a contact list (contact.xml) that can be moved to other application installations, reducing manual data entry

-   performs metadata record generation for dataset or service applications

-   graphics overview links and data online links can be added within jNAP.
