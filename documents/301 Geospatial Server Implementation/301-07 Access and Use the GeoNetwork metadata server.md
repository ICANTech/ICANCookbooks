**Purpose:**

This document describes the access to the Metadata Server, how to perform simple and advanced searches, and how to create various display and data outputs. The following description is for the ‘classic’ user interface.

The general description is thoroughly described in the GeoNetwork Users Manual (<http://geonetwork-opensource.org/manuals/2.10.3/eng/users/GeoNetworkUserManual.pdf> ) at time of writing ).

This is only required for administrative functions such as editing and deleting records  |
| 2        | There are **two search modes**, simple and advanced. Almost invariably, the \<simple\> search as displayed on the splash screen will suffice.                                                                                           |                                                                                                                                                    |
| 3        | The **common approach** is to select a geographic window, and place one or more search terms to be searched. If there are too many results, narrow the search by bounding box and by search terms                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
            The **advanced search** permits specific title, abstract, keywords, credit, data parameters and taxonomic names. This is in addition to optionally selecting a geographic bounding box, temporal extent and metadata change date range.  | Result is \<Google-like\>.
