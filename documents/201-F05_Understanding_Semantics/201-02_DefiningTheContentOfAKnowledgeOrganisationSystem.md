## Defining the content of a Knowledge Organisation System ##

### Process Number: 201-02 ###

### Purpose ###
To enable ICAN data providers to create new entries in a Knowledge Organisation System, or to create a new Knowldege Organisation System

|**Step**|**Details**|**Reference**|
|--------|-----------|-------------|
|     1.   |  Identify the specific domain for the required Knowledge Organisation System |   Examples include <ul><li>Coastal erosion</li><li>Names and extents of beaches</li></ul> This approach ensures the content in the new Knowledge Organisation System is tightly defined, coherent and has few overlaps with existing resources.  |
| 2. | Identify the required content of the Knowledge Organisation System <ul><li>For a given level of a knowledge organization system the definitions of a term may be as broad or as narrow as is necessary, as long as they are not ambiguous. </li></ul> |when building a hierarchical thesaurus, it is important that concepts defined at the same level of the hierarchy maintain a similar degree of granularity. If the thesaurus is imagined as a pyramid, making a concept at a given level too narrow or broad in its definition is like placing a too small or too large brick in the wall of the pyramid, and makes the structure unstable. For example, “body of water” should not sit at the same level as “lake” or “reservoir”, as these are terms with a narrower relationship or a finer granularity.  |
|3. | Link the newly defined contentof the Knowledge Organisation System <ul><li>The definition of terms by themselves is useful but the impact of the work can be greatly extended by providing relationships which link the terms together to form networks of knowledge. This enhances the ability of a user to find data labelled with a given term or to translate the metadata from one mark up scheme to another.</li></ul> | <ul><li></li>Relationships can be thought of simply as broader and narrower (for example, a Parameter Discovery Vocabulary is narrower than a Parameter Groups Vocabulary and vice versa); loosely related ; and synonyms where two terms may be used interchangeably</ul> |
