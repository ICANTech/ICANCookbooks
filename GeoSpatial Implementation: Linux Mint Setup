| 1	      |Download Linux Mint:                                  |                          |
|	      |- Download an ISO image from http://www.linuxmint.com |                          |
|	      |- Save the result to a CD	                         |- the flavour of Linux Mint is a free choice.  Linux Mint 17 was used|
|	      |                                                      |- the 64-bit version is often preferred, because it has a large address space|
| 2	      |Install Linux Mint.                                   |                          |
|         |- start the hardware with the CD in an optical drive  |                          |
|	      |- answer the questions                                |- The installation will normally reformat the hard drive.  Options are presented to install multiple versions, and to change hard drive partitions|
|	      |-  Choose a strong master user password               |                          |
| 3	      |Run Update Manager to get any changes since the version release.	|- This will fully update the operating system so that no known flaws are unpatched. |
| 4	      |Run Device Manager	                                 |- This will update the operating system for any special wifi or graphics adapter software |
| 5       |Install firewall||
|         |- issue “Sudo apt-install gufw”                       |                          |
